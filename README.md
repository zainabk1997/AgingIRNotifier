## Aging Incident Response Notifier

## Introduction
The Aging IR Notifier System uses Google Sheets as a database to send emails notifying resources about pending tickets according to priority based on SLA rules. The resource receives an email everyday about the tickets assigned to them and they can quickly skim the ticket information such as the user name, ticket number, description, JIRA ID associated with it, and SLA validity. 

## Installation
The code works on Google App Scripts which needs to be set for the Google Sheets where the data has been entered. Take a pull of the repository and run it in the Script section of Google Sheets. 

## Troubleshooting
